# App_Detect_Hateful_Tweets


First app with Flask.

In this app we try to classify tweets into 3 classes: hateful, offensive and neither.    
The **NLP model** to classify the tweets is a Multinomial Naive Bayes with a TfidfVectorizer for preprocessing in the **pipeline**.    
You will also see some more preprocessing to clean the data, but the classifier model itself is not optimal, it is just a testing model to create a first app with Flask. Choose your own model and try to have the best predictions from your app with Flask.
