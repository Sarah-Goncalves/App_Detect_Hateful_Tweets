# App_Detect_Hateful_Tweets


First app with Flask.

The **NLP model** to classify the tweets into 3 classes (hateful, offensive and neither) is a Multinomial Naive Bayes with a TfidfVectorizer for preprocessing in the **pipeline**.    
You will see some more preprocessing to clean the data, but the classifier model itself is not optimal, it is just a testing model to create a first app with Flask.
